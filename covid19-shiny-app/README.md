# STAT 385 Fall 2020 Final Project - covid19-shiny-app
This is the app repo for the final project. We are creating a Shiny app (for free) using all the skills acquired in this course and elsewhere as statistics programmers. This project is a collaboration of our individual expression as programmers. The final version of our Shiny app will need to be completed (production and testing it out) and successfully working by 11:59 pm Monday December 14, 2020. The goal is to create a COVID-19 app that provides a user with helpful, beautiful information about COVID-19. That information can be links to websites, data visualizations, tables, maps, statistics, where to go from help, etc. Ultimately, we want any person to use our app and have an awesome experience with it.

Each student is expected to make 10 contributions (ideas plus code plus committing and pushing those ideas/code) to the covid19-shiny-app repo. Each contribution is worth 8 points for a maximum of 80 points. A contribution will be deemed valid by the Instructor only. Students can expect a valid contribution to be a line of code that you created or a line of code that you added. Spelling corrections count as one valid contribution for each student, but spelling contributions are counted one time only per student. This means that if student X creates a pull request for a spelling correction or typo, and it is deemed valid by the Instructor (and merged to the master branch of the repo), then student X cannot contribute any more spelling corrctions or typos for points. If student X chooses to do more than one spelling correction or typo contribution on their own volition, then that is student X's choice. Your ideas and coding must be **your own code**.

After cloning this repo, pull this repo, so that you have the latest version of the repo (and the app.R file). When you are ready to make your contribution official, create a pull request (you can do this by visiting the Pull Requests tab of the repo https://github-dev.cs.illinois.edu/stat385-fa20/covid19-shiny-app/pulls). Describe your contribution and the Instructor will determine if the contribution is valid, which means your contribution will be merged and officially a part of the Shiny app.

In Weeks 13, 15, 16, and 17, the Instructor will not have a video lecture the way that he did in the past. Instead, the Instructor will host live QnA sessions on Tuesdays at 10 am until 11 am in Zoom (register here https://illinois.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZMpcOyprTIvGNd7JmOlKBZp-UQ9_mmkhIh4).

**When you have questions about the final project, ask your question in the Issues board of the covid19-shiny-app repo; DO NOT use the course-materials repo Issues board to ask about the final project. It will be much easier to keep up with the progress of the app and your questions about the app in the covid19-shiny-app repo.**

Datasets about COVID-19 that must be used in this Shiny app are:

- NYTimes US Historical Data https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us.csv

- NYTimes US States Historical Data https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-states.csv

- NYTimes US Counties Historical Data https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-counties.csv

- COVID Tracking Project US Historical Data https://covidtracking.com/data/download/national-history.csv

Other websites with COVID-19 related information may be used in our Shiny app upon the Instructor's approval. Students can make suggestions via email or the Issues for this `covid19-shiny-app` repo.
