## Week 12 Practice Problems Solutions
### Created by Prof. Christopher Kinson

**#1** (RMarkdown, R Objects, their modes, and attributes, R Lists and data frames, What is data, Importing data, Importing data with the tidyverse) Import the data set below using either base R or tidyverse functionality. 

- [Vote By Mail Data](https://uofi.box.com/shared/static/dty5bxsi8pa4dfgly7ap9jtcp1806imy.csv). 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
vote <- read_csv("https://uofi.box.com/shared/static/dty5bxsi8pa4dfgly7ap9jtcp1806imy.csv", 
                                                   col_types = cols(`Ballot Req Date` = col_date(format = "%m/%d/%Y"), 
                                                                    `Ballot Sent Date` = col_date(format = "%m/%d/%Y"), 
                                                                    `Ballot Received Date` = col_date(format = "%m/%d/%Y")))
```


**#2** Using the imported Champaign County Vote By Mail Data, base R plotting, and the image below as a guide, re-create the data visualization as closely as possible. *Your percentages will differ from the image below.*

This code chunk contains the data wrangling steps needed for Problems 2 and 3.
```{r}

#checking to see which dates are not the same in both datasets

This chunk contains the plotting steps to re-create the data visualization in base R.
