## Now, we share solutions to the Task to Do (at bottom of) Week 13 Notes

Here are more examples of Shiny apps:

### 1. Using Shiny, make a histogram with the `faithful` data (one of R's internal datasets). Allow the user to change the number of observations for the waiting column.

```{r}
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  
  # Sidebar with a slider input for number of bins 
  sliderInput(inputId = "dat",
              label = "Number of observations:",
              min = 1,
              max = nrow(faithful),
              value = 10), #the comma is important
  
  # Show a plot of the generated distribution
  plotOutput(outputId = "distPlot")
)

# Define server logic required to draw a histogram
server <- function(input, output) {
  
  output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
    # generate bins based on input$bins from ui.R
    x    <- faithful[1:input$dat, 2]
    #bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)
    
    # draw the histogram with the specified number of bins
    hist(x, col = 'darkgray', border = 'white', main="Histogram of Old Faithful Waiting Times until Next Eruption")
  })
}

# Run the application 
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server, options = list(height = 500))
```


### 2. Using Shiny, make a histogram with the `faithful` data (which is already inside of R). Allow the user to change the number of observations for the eruptions column.

```{r}
ui <- fluidPage(
  
  # Sidebar with a slider input for number of bins 
  sliderInput(inputId = "dat",
              label = "Number of observations:",
              min = 1,
              max = nrow(faithful),
              value = 10), #the comma is important
  
  # Show a plot of the generated distribution
  plotOutput(outputId = "distPlot")
)

# Define server logic required to draw a histogram
server <- function(input, output) {
  
  output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
    # generate bins based on input$bins from ui.R
    x    <- faithful[1:input$dat, 1]
    #bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)
    
    # draw the histogram with the specified number of bins
    hist(x, col = 'darkgray', border = 'white', main="Histogram of Old Faithful Eruption Times")
  })
}

# Run the application 
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server, options = list(height = 500))
```


### 3. Using Shiny, make a scatter plot with the `faithful` data (which is already inside of R). Allow the user to change the number of observations for both x (eruptions) and y (waiting) variables.

```{r}
#NOT SO NICE!

ui <- fluidPage(
  
  # Sidebar with a slider input for number of bins 
  sliderInput(inputId = "datx",
              label = "Observations for Eruption times:",
              min = 1,
              max = nrow(faithful),
              value = 10), #the comma is important
  
  sliderInput(inputId = "daty",
              label = "Observations for Waiting times until next eruption:",
              min = 1,
              max = nrow(faithful),
              value = 10), #the comma is important
  
  # Show a plot of the generated distribution
  plotOutput(outputId = "scatPlot")
)

# Define server logic required to draw a histogram
server <- function(input, output) {
  
  output$scatPlot <- renderPlot({
    # generate bins based on input$bins from ui.R
    x    <- faithful[1:input$datx, 1]
    y    <- faithful[1:input$daty, 2]
    
    # draw the scatter plot
    plot(x, y, col = 'darkgray', xlab="eruption time in minutes", ylab="waiting time in minutes", pch=16, main="Old Faithful Geyser Data")
  })
}

# Run the application 
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server, options = list(height = 800))
```

Below is a nicer Shiny app.
```{r}
ui <- fluidPage(
  
  # Sidebar with a slider input for number of bins 
  sliderInput(inputId = "datx",
              label = "Number of observations:",
              min = 1,
              max = nrow(faithful),
              value = 10), #the comma is important
  
  # Show a plot of the generated distribution
  plotOutput(outputId = "scatPlot")
)

# Define server logic required to draw a histogram
server <- function(input, output) {
  
  output$scatPlot <- renderPlot({
    # generate bins based on input$bins from ui.R
    x    <- faithful[1:input$datx, 1]
    y    <- faithful[1:input$datx, 2]
    
    # draw the scatter plot
    plot(x, y, col = 'darkgray', xlab="eruption time in minutes", ylab="waiting time in minutes", pch=16, main="Old Faithful Geyser Data")
  })
}

# Run the application 
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server, options = list(height = 500))
```

### We introduced Reactivity in the Week 13 Notes

When a user changes an input value in the app and the app output changes as a result, that is called **reactivity**.

If we want the **output** (histogram in the above app) to change after the user changes the **input** (slider in the above app), then we need to use the `input$`* matching the Id of the input in the ui and that input must go inside the `render*()` function. *If we do this correctly, then the reactivity occurs automatically!*

**Reactive values** (i.e. the `input$`) work together with **reactive functions.** 

You cannot call a **reactive value** if it's not inside of a **reactive function**.


## More on Reactive Tools for Shiny

- **Reactive values** *notify* (that changes are taking place)

- **Reactive functions** *respond* (to the changes)

- When we use `input$`, we are creating an input list that contains reactive values

- There are 6 frequently used **reactive tools** that each build object(s) that will *respond* to changes in a set if reactive values (`input$`)


1. `render*()` **render reactive output**

    - builds an object that is tied to specific type of output

```{r}
ui <- fluidPage(
  
  # Sidebar with a slider input for number of bins 
  textInput(inputId = "question",
              label = "Please write your thoughts here:"
              ), #the comma is important
  
  # Show a plot of the generated distribution
  verbatimTextOutput(outputId = "answer")
)

# Define server logic required to draw a histogram
server <- function(input, output) {
  
  output$answer <- renderPrint({
    print(input$question)
  })
}

# Run the application 
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server, options = list(height = 500))
```


2. `reactive()` **modify reactions**

    - builds a reactive object called a "reactive expression" which acts like a new function
    
```{r}
ui <- fluidPage(
  
  # Sidebar with a slider input for number of bins 
  sliderInput(inputId = "size",
              label = "Number of observations:",
              min = 1,
              max = 1e3,
              value = 10), #the comma is important
  
  # Show a plot of the generated distribution
  plotOutput(outputId = "scatPlot")
)

# Define server logic required to draw a histogram
server <- function(input, output) {
  
  output$scatPlot <- renderPlot({
    # generate bins based on input$bins from ui.R
    dat <- reactive({
      rnorm(input$size)
    })
    # draw the scatter plot
    plot(cbind(dat(),dat()), col = 'darkgray', pch=16, main="Normally Distributed Data")
  })
}

# Run the application 
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server, options = list(height = 500))
```

    
3. `isolate()` **prevent reactions**

    - sets something to be a non-reactive value thus preventing values from being up-to-date

```{r}
ui <- fluidPage(
 sliderInput(inputId = "num",
  label = "Choose a number",
  min = 1, 
  max = 100,
  value = 25),
 
 textInput(inputId = "title",
  label = "Write a title",
  value = "Scatter Plot of Random Normal Values"),
 
 plotOutput("scat")
)

server <- function(input, output) {
 output$scat <- renderPlot({
  plot(x=rnorm(input$num),y=rnorm(input$num), main = isolate({input$title}))
 })
}

shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server, options = list(height = 800))
```


4. `observeEvent()` **trigger code**

    - defines reactive values such that they trigger other code to run

```{r}
ui <- fluidPage(
 
 textInput(inputId = "selection",
  label = "Pick any number between 1 and 100"),
 
 actionButton(inputId = "clicks",
 label = "Select"),
 
 verbatimTextOutput(outputId = "pc")
)

server <- function(input, output) {
  observeEvent(input$clicks, {
                output$pc <- renderPrint({ print(paste("the Computer was thinking of the number",sample(1:100,1)))})
   })
}

shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server, options = list(height = 500))
```

    
5. `eventReactive()` **delay reactions**

    - a reactive expression that only responds to specific events thus delaying reactivity

```{r}
ui <- fluidPage(
 
 textInput(inputId = "selection",
  label = "Pick any number between 1 and 100"),
 
 actionButton(inputId = "clicks",
 label = "Select"),
 
 verbatimTextOutput(outputId = "pc")
)

server <- function(input, output) {
  change <- eventReactive(input$clicks, { 
    input$selection })
  
  output$pc <- renderPrint({ print(paste("the Computer was thinking of the number",sample(1:change(),1)))})
}

shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server, options = list(height = 500))
```


6. `reactiveValue()`  **create your own reactive values**

    - creates a list of reactive values to manipulate

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
mpg2 <- filter(mpg, manufacturer == "chevrolet" | manufacturer == "dodge" | manufacturer == "ford" | manufacturer =="jeep" | manufacturer =="lincoln" | manufacturer =="mercury" | manufacturer == "pontiac")

ui <- fluidPage(
 actionButton(inputId = "cyli", label = "Cylinders"),
 
 actionButton(inputId = "driv", label = "Drivetrain"),

 plotOutput("bars")
)

server <- function(input, output) {
 rv <- reactiveValues(data = mpg2)
 
 observeEvent(input$cyli, { rv$data <- table(mpg2$cyl) })
 
 observeEvent(input$driv, { rv$data <- table(mpg2$drv) })
 
 output$bars <- renderPlot({ barplot(rv$data, border="white", horiz = TRUE, xlab="frequency") })
}

shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server, options = list(height = 600))
```


## Task to Do

1. Create a magic 8 ball Shiny app. The user must ask yes or no questions. The 8 ball responds with one of 20 possible answers. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball for the possible answers. 

```{r}
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  textInput(inputId="question",label="Ask the magic 8 ball a question:"),
  actionButton(inputId="click",label="Ask question"),
  verbatimTextOutput(outputId="ans")
)

server <- function(input,output){
  reply <- c("It is certain.","It is decidedly so.","Without a doubt.","Yes – definitely.",
             "You may rely on it.","As I see it, yes.","Most likely.","Outlook good.","Yes.",
             "Signs point to yes.","Reply hazy, try again.","Ask again later.","Better not tell you now.",
             "Cannot predict now.","Concentrate and ask again.","Don't count on it.","My reply is no.",
             "My sources say no.","Outlook not so good.","Very doubtful.")
  observeEvent(input$click,{
    output$ans <- renderPrint({print(sample(reply,1))})
  })
}

shinyApp(ui=ui,server=server)
```

2. Add an image of the 8 ball to the shiny app in Problem 1.

```{r}
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  img(src='220px-Magic8ball.jpg', align = "right"),
  textInput(inputId="question",label="Ask the magic 8 ball a question:"),
  actionButton(inputId="click",label="Ask question"),
  verbatimTextOutput(outputId="ans")
)

server <- function(input,output){
  reply <- c("It is certain.","It is decidedly so.","Without a doubt.","Yes – definitely.",
             "You may rely on it.","As I see it, yes.","Most likely.","Outlook good.","Yes.",
             "Signs point to yes.","Reply hazy, try again.","Ask again later.","Better not tell you now.",
             "Cannot predict now.","Concentrate and ask again.","Don't count on it.","My reply is no.",
             "My sources say no.","Outlook not so good.","Very doubtful.")
  observeEvent(input$click,{
    output$ans <- renderPrint({print(sample(reply,1))})
  })
}

shinyApp(ui=ui,server=server)
```

3. There's something not quite right about the following Shiny app and its code. Fix it.

```{r}
library(shiny)
ui <- fluidPage(
  
  # Sidebar with a slider input for number of bins 
  sliderInput(inputId = "size",
              label = "Number of observations:",
              min = 1,
              max = 1e6,
              value = 30), #the comma is important
  
  # Show a plot of the generated distribution
  plotOutput(outputId = "histPlot"),
  verbatimTextOutput(outputId = "sumtable")
)

# Define server logic required to draw a histogram
server <- function(input, output) {
  
  output$histPlot <- renderPlot({
    
    # draw the histogram plot
    hist(rnorm(input$size), col = 'darkgray', xlab="", main="Normal Distribution")
  })
  
  output$sumtable <- renderPrint({
    summary(rnorm(input$size))
  })
}

# Run the application 
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server, options = list(height = 600))
```


4. For the `reactiveValues()` example, add another button such that it plots a single bar plot for the counts of the levels of both factors (not stacked but side-by-side).

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
mpg2 <- filter(mpg, manufacturer == "chevrolet" | manufacturer == "dodge" | manufacturer == "ford" | manufacturer =="jeep" | manufacturer =="lincoln" | manufacturer =="mercury" | manufacturer == "pontiac")

ui <- fluidPage(
 actionButton(inputId = "cyli", label = "Cylinders"),
 
 actionButton(inputId = "driv", label = "Drivetrain"),
 
 actionButton(inputId = "both", label = "Both"),

 plotOutput("bars")
)

server <- function(input, output) {
 rv <- reactiveValues(data = mpg2)
 drv1<-cbind(rep("drv",length(mpg2$drv)),mpg2$drv)
 cyl1<-cbind(rep("cyl",length(mpg2$cyl)),mpg2$cyl)
 comb<-rbind(cyl1,drv1)
 
 observeEvent(input$cyli, { rv$data <- table(mpg2$cyl) })
 
 observeEvent(input$driv, { rv$data <- table(mpg2$drv) })
 
 observeEvent(input$both, { rv$data <- table(comb[,2],comb[,1]) })
 
 output$bars <- renderPlot({ barplot(rv$data, border="white", horiz = TRUE, beside=TRUE, xlab="frequency") })
}

shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server, options = list(height = 600))
```
