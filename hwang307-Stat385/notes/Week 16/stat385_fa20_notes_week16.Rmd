## We're finishing up Shiny apps!!!

Execute the chunks within this Rmd file on your local computer to see and interact with the Shiny app.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
#
# This is a Shiny web application. You can run the application by clicking
# the 'Run App' button above.

library(shiny)

# Define UI for application that draws a histogram
ui <- fluidPage(
  
    # Sidebar with a slider input for number of bins 
      sliderInput(inputId = "bins",
                        label = "Number of bins:",
                        min = 1,
                        max = 50,
                        value = 30), #the comma is important
      
    # Show a plot of the generated distribution
      plotOutput("distPlot")
      )

# Define server logic required to draw a histogram
server <- function(input, output) {

    output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
        # generate bins based on input$bins from ui.R
        x    <- faithful[, 2]
        bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)

        # draw the histogram with the specified number of bins
        hist(x, breaks = bins, col = 'darkgray', border = 'white')
  })
}

# Run the application 
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server, options = list(height = 500))

```

## Please watch Parts 1-3 of the [Shiny app tutorial](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/) by RStudio to learn more on your own.

The following notes are from Grolemund's video and slides https://github.com/rstudio-education/shiny.rstudio.com-tutorial.

## Improve the appearance of Shiny apps via the User Interface

### Static content

- We use `tags$` functions to customize the app's UI content

  - The different tags add HTML content in the background to the app

  - Please see the tags glossary https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/tag-glossary.html for more details

```{r}
library(shiny)

# Define UI for application that draws a histogram
ui <- fluidPage(
  
    tags$p("This is an introduction for this app. It's a very simple app for the Old Faithful geyser eruptions."),
    
    tags$p("Below is our first input, i.e., a slider, so that the user can change the values."),
    
    # Sidebar with a slider input for number of bins 
      sliderInput(inputId = "bins",
                        label = "Number of bins:",
                        min = 1,
                        max = 50,
                        value = 30), #the comma is important
    
    tags$p("Below is the output of the plot, i.e. histogram."), 
    
    # Show a plot of the generated distribution
      plotOutput("distPlot")
      )

# Define server logic required to draw a histogram
server <- function(input, output) {

    output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
        # generate bins based on input$bins from ui.R
        x    <- faithful[, 2]
        bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)

        # draw the histogram with the specified number of bins
        hist(x, breaks = bins, col = 'darkgray', border = 'white')
  })
}

# Run the application 
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server, options = list(height = 500))
```


### Layout

- We can organize the layout into a grid and adjust the position of content with `fluidRow()` and `column()` functions.

- The `offset=` argument of the `column()` function will allow the content to shift by a certain number of units.

```{r}
# Define UI for application that draws a histogram
ui <- fluidPage(
    
   fluidRow(
     column(4,
    # Sidebar with a slider input for number of bins 
      sliderInput(inputId = "bins",
                        label = "Number of bins:",
                        min = 1,
                        max = 50,
                        value = 30)
   ),  #the comma is important
   
    column(8,
    # Show a plot of the generated distribution
      plotOutput("distPlot")
      )
  )
)
# Define server logic required to draw a histogram
server <- function(input, output) {

    output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
        # generate bins based on input$bins from ui.R
        x    <- faithful[, 2]
        bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)

        # draw the histogram with the specified number of bins
        hist(x, breaks = bins, col = 'darkgray', border = 'white')
  })
}

# Run the application 
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server, options = list(height = 500))
```


### Panels

- There are several types of panels. These panels allow for visually cleaner access to inputs and outputs.

### Cascading style sheets (CSS)

- CSS add all the beautiful color and aesthetics to your apps and webpages on the internet. Without CSS, several webpages would look quite plain.

See tutorials at https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css and https://zendev.com/ultimate-guide-to-learning-css.html to learn more about CSS for little to no financial cost.
